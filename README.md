Here is my Maze generator and solver. <br/>
The file contains 2 classes: 
- 1 Maze that can be printed in the terminal, I use it just to get the maze's data. <br/>
- the same but displayed with the built-in tkinter library. <br/>

They can have differents Width and Height. <br/>

## ðŸ§  Algorithms

### Generation

we first generate a grid of 0 for the walls and a different int for each holes. So the dimensions of the labyrinth must be odd. <br/>
Then we break the entrance and the exit.<br/>

Then we pick a wall randomly and check if the two cells next to it have a different number. <br/>
If this is the case, we unify the cells by giving them the smallest number. <br/>
Using this technique the numbers of ways and walls are fixed by: <br/>
- walls: 0.5(Width*Height +Width +Height) -1.5 <br/>
- ways:  0.5(Width*Height -Width -Height) +1.5 

we just have to count the number of ways at the beginning and add 1 each time we break a wall. <br/>
Our maze is done when the number of counted ways is equal tu the equation above. <br/>

### Resolving

We test the start, we set its value to 2. <br/>
the right, bottom, top and left cells are tested in this order. <br/>
once all the adjacent cells are tested, the cell is not in the path, it is reset to 1. <br/>
as soon as a square arrives at the finish we go up the path (in the graphic version we put these cells in green). <br/>
With this proceed we don't find the shortest path each times but it is not a problem since our maze have only 1 path. <br/>
